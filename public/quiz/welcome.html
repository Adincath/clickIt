				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Klikit is a web app that allows an instructor to test users through a small quiz. The quiz is made available, while users,
					on any smart device, take the quiz. This app applies real time technologies to provide instant feedback to both instructor
					and students.

				<h3>Technology</h3>
				<p>
					We are using modern frameworks in order to keep our app fast and current. We employment popular techonologies such as NodeJS
					and express for our server technologies. These tools help us handle requests from users and mediate data to our database.
					Google Firebase is a new real time data base that allows programs to be more event driven so that the user can have
					a snappier and responsive experience. The look and feel of our web site is very important to us. We chose to use AngularJS
					and Angular Material to give our web site a sleek and clean feeling.

					Klikit was created for a senior seminar class at the University of Tennessee at Martin. The programmers behind the idea are
					Brooks Becton and Cody Thomason. Long hours of bug chasing and meeting have been put into Klikit.
