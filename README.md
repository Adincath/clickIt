# Klikit

##About
Klikit is a web app that allows an instructor to test users through a small quiz. The quiz is made available by the instructor, while users on any smart device take the quiz. This app applies real time technologies to provide instant feedback to both instructor and students. Klikit takes advantage of many  newer technologies. On server side and database we are using Node.js, Express, and Google Firebase. For UX we are using  AngularJS and Angular Material.
##Semester Goals
Our goal during the semester is to get a multiple choice quiz working. This entails storing quiz information in the database, passing data from our server to multiple test takers, and designing quiz serving and quiz taking classes in a way to allow for different types of quizzes to be taken in future development. 
##Future Goals
Our quiz classes should be able to inherit from a base quiz class. We will use that base class to make child classes that will be able to parse quiz information and serve it out to quiz takers as needed depending on what type of quiz is given and what kind of information is needed from the quiz takers. 

We also want to tie in Google Docs. We can take raw data collected from the quiz and store that data to a Google drive. From there, we would be able to provide analytics in any form offered by Google Docs, such as sheets, charts, and graphs. Storing these results onto drive allows us to save storage on our servers and allows an instructor to get all the advantages of using Google Docs.
